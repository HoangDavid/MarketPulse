GOAL: Market sentiment (tech sector,) analysis and linked to event that cause 

TODO:
- Reformat the payload
- Backend handle retry logic, concurrent API calls, and duplidcate requests

- track sentiment and stock price changes correlation using rolling correlation
    - have mongoDB up first to store all the data over the year for sentiment score and stock prices
        - for sentiment use market sentiment indicator to aid the lack of social sentiment
    - historical: store the stock price / sentiment score by the days (5 days, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year)
    - real-time:
        - store the stock price / sentiment score by the hours in the current day
        - after the day calculate the average sentiment / correlation after the end of day

- Highlight key events on the timeline that connect changes to the stock price movment (somehow ???)
- Rank those events in terms of influence (top 10)

- Fetch/calculate the market sentiment indicators
- write the functions for preprocessing in utils folder to do targeted sentiment analysis / find a aspect-based model
- real-time update (from terminal) sentiment score using both social sentiment and weighted market sentiment indcators



Helpful command:
- To run the app for FASTAPI: uvicorn main:app --reload
- To run the frontend: yarn run dev
- To start mongodb server in docker: docker run --name mongodb -d -p 27017:27017 -v mongo-data:/data/db mongo


Data flow (maybe):
....

Core functionalities:
- sentiemnt correlation analysis (lagged: 0, -1, -2 ) -> only extreme sentiment + high interest rate have affects
