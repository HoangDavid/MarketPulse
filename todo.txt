GOAL: Market sentiment (tech sector,) analysis and linked to event that cause 

TODO:
FrontEnd:
- Top bar similar to Yahoo Finance. With logo "Market Pulse!" + search bar (ticker + company name)
- Stock and sentiment graph + key events rank by sentiment extreme (pos -> neg -> mixed) (filter by year / month / week / day)
- Fear/Greed indicator + graph
- 4 market indcators graph + for each graph fear / greed conclusion


BackEnd:
- update for sentiment conlusion on each end point of market sentiment
- Set up MongoDB for data storage
- Use redis for fast databse retrieval
- Backend handle retry logic, concurrent API calls, and duplidcate requests (maybe use Kafka here)
- Make the retreiving of each companies data (when already sought for updated hourly) -> real time update? -> hard nut to crack


Helpful command:
- To run the app for FASTAPI: uvicorn main:app --reload
- To run the frontend: yarn run dev
- To start mongodb server in docker: docker run --name mongodb -d -p 27017:27017 -v mongo-data:/data/db mongo


Data flow (maybe):
....

Core functionalities:
- sentiemnt correlation analysis (lagged: 0, -1, -2 ) -> only extreme sentiment + high interest rate have affects
