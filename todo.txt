TODO:
- call Yahoo API for data  V
- endpoint for sentiment analysis model (distilbert-uncased)
- write the functions for preprocessing in utils folder to do targeted sentiment analysis
- find a correlation formula for relationship between sentiment analysis and stock price -> maybe rolling correlation
- Maybe find an API for news article for tech headlines



Helpful command:
- To run the app for FASTAPI: uvicorn main:app --reload


Data flow (maybe):
- Data (subreddits) from API is processed and stored in Kafka topics (data has timeout delete to release resource) with cluster
- A hosted model call for new data using a consumer (multiple consumers) hourly to process and stored the processed data in MongoDB

- Data (Yahoo stock markets) from API is processed  and stored ____
- Consumer call for the sentiment analysis score and stock market price and calculate correlation score then rank events
