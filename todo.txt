TODO:
- find a targeted sentiment analysis model -> maybe rolling correlation
- find a model to calcualte the correlation score between financial events and stock prices



Helpful command:
- To run the app for FASTAPI: uvicorn main:app --reload


Data flow (maybe):
- Data (subreddits) from API is processed and stored in Kafka topics (data has timeout delete to release resource) with cluster
- A hosted model call for new data using a consumer (multiple consumers) hourly to process and stored the processed data in MongoDB

- Data (Yahoo stock markets) from API is processed  and stored ____
- Consumer call for the sentiment analysis score and stock market price and calculate correlation score then rank events
